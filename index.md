My primary research interest is at the intersection of Text Mining and Natural Language Processing. 
More specifically I've worked on a variety of problems involving Trust/Misinformation, Social Media Analysis, and Humor.  My thesis is on text representation and creating models which simultaneously produce new knowledge from data, while maintaining feature interpretability.

Currently I am interested in problems involving user behavior in social media and computational social science. I am also involved in an effort to curb COVID-19 severe misinformation.
