I"·<p>My primary research interest is at the intersection of Text Mining and Natural Language Processing. 
More specifically Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of problems involving Trust/Misinformation, Social Media Analysis, and Humor.  My thesis is on text representation and creating models which simultaneously produce new knowledge from data, while maintaining feature interpretability.</p>

<p>Currently I am interested in problems involving faithful interpretability, and model explainability. I am also involved in effort to curb COVID-19 severe misinformation.</p>
